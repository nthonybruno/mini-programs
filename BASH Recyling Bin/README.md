A simple bash script to provide the basic functionality of a recycle bin. 
In addition to moving files into the recycle bin directory, the script must be able to list and
purge the files that have been placed into the recycle bin. This script acts as a substitute for 
the rm command, giving the user a chance to recover files deleted accidentally. Note that 
restoring the files is not part of this exercise.
